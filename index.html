				<p>I'm Nate, a web developer, home cooking enthusiast, and musician based on the Big Island of Hawaii.</p>

				<p>I am also a husband, dog lover, and I love to swim, snorkel, and explore this beautiful island.</p>

				<h2>Web Developer <span>Nate</span></h2>

				<p>I have been working as an agency developer since 2016. While I started out primarily working with front end technologies, agency work has exposed me to the full stack, working with WordPress APIs, PHP, and MySQL.

				<h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>

				<p>I have experience crafting front ends using the following technologies:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Semantic Markup</li>
					<li>CSS, Scss</li>
					<li>React.js</li>
					<li>jQuery</li>
				</ul>

				<p>My approach is to consider the user and how they will navigate an interface. I approach front-end development with accessibility in mind.</p>

				<h3>WordPress Development</h3>

				<p>I have experience with all aspects of WordPress development, including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Theme Development</li>
					<li>Plugin Development</li>
					<li>Block Development</li>
					<li>Extending the REST API</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I have experience in building custom solutions and extending existing solutions.</p>

				<p>When working with WordPress, my approach is to find logical solutions for clients. Sometimes this means configuring off-the-shelf plugins, but other times this means creating abstraction layers over existing APIs.</p>

				<h3>Other Technologies</h3>

				<p>This site is built using the Next.js framework, which has been a joy to work with. For posts, this site queries a WordPress backend via GraphQL (using the amazin WP GraphQL plugin).</p>

				<p>I have experience working with git in a collaborative environment.</p>

				<p>For build tooling, I tend to reach for Parcel nowadays when I need to configure from scratch.</p>

				<h2>Home Cook <span>Nate</span></h2>

				<p>I started cooking as a kid, using the toaster and microwave to make some of my favorite childhood snacks. Throught the years I have binged food-related content and have started collecting cookbooks, appliances, and other cooking gear.</p>

				<p>I am largely self taught with books and videos. My "professional" kitchen experience amounts to my high school job at a McDonald's and my college job when I worked the fryer and delivered food for a "Chinese" restaurant.</p>

				<p>A turning point in my journey as a home cook was the first season of Mind of a Chef. That show changed the way I viewed food and cooking.</p>

				<p>I love everything from Julia Child and Jacques Pepin recipes, to cooking brisket or pizza outdoors.</p>

				<h2>Musician <span>Nate</span></h2>

				<p>I have played drums and percussion since I was ten years old. I continued throughout high school and studied percussion in college.</p>

				<p>Today, I primarily play drums, but have started to dabble in guitar, ukulele, and keyboard.</p>
